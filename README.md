## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The introduction outlines the evolution of GPT models from informal applications to complex tasks across various industries. It highlights the advancements in GPT-4, emphasizing its enhanced reasoning and knowledge retention capabilities. The study aims to explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of employing GPT-4 as an interrogation tool.

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

The methodology section describes three specific cases where the effectiveness of GPT-4 in investigative scenarios is evaluated. Each case involves simulated conversations with the AI, assessing its ability to gather information and make deductions. The study employs various interrogation techniques to test the AI's performance.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The results section summarizes the findings from all three cases. It provides concise insights into the AI's performance in initiating conversations, formulating inquiries, and analyzing responses. However, it also acknowledges limitations, particularly in determining the truthfulness of statements.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The conclusion reflects on the overall performance of GPT-4 as an investigative tool. It acknowledges the AI's potential but highlights significant constraints, particularly in assessing the veracity of responses. The conclusion underscores the need for further research and development to enhance the AI's effectiveness.

## Future Works <a name="future-works"></a>

The future works section outlines potential areas for improvement in the AI's investigative capabilities. It suggests broadening the scope of inquiry, refining interrogation methods, and ensuring adherence to ethical standards. The section emphasizes the importance of ongoing research and development to overcome identified constraints.

## References <a name="references"></a>

The references section provides links to relevant documentation and tools used in the study, including the GPT-4 System Card and LangChainWithFiles.ipynb. It also acknowledges sources for paraphrased information from platforms like OpenAI Chat and QuillBot.

## Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>
