## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

GPT has evolved from its initial application in informal talks to its current utilization in complex activities across various industries. The progress of GPT is clearly visible through its updates. According to an OpenAI document on GPT 4, it has demonstrated enhanced capabilities in reasoning and knowledge retention. Additionally, one of the safety challenges that has been noted is the possibility for risky emergent behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the potential advantages or disadvantages of utilizing GPT-4 as an interrogation officer.

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

### Case 1: Lying or Not <a name="case-1-lying-or-not"></a>

Case Details:

Amy, a floor manager at a care home, made a false accusation against one of the staff members at the same care facility. The accusation is that the staff engaged in a willful act of neglect towards one of the service users. However, there is dissenting opinion among other staff members.

Investigation Method Performed:

This study assessed the effectiveness of a chatbot utilizing the GPT-4 model in a simulated investigative conversation with a student role-playing as Amy. The objective was to evaluate the chatbot's capacity to ascertain the honesty of an individual's answers and collect case-related information.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

Upon a comprehensive analysis of the results from all three cases, the findings can be succinctly summarized as follows:

[Summarize the key findings...]

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The examination of the prompt employed in the three case studies, together with the ensuing dialogue with the bot, indicates that although the chatbot shows promise as an investigative tool, it has significant constraints. The main limitation is its incapacity to determine the truthfulness of the respondent's statements.

## Future Works <a name="future-works"></a>

These findings indicate that the chatbot has the capability to operate efficiently as an investigation tool. Nevertheless, in order to completely achieve this potential and overcome those identified constraints, additional research and development in other areas are necessary.
