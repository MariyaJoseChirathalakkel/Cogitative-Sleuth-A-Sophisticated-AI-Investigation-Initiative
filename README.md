## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Cogitative Sleuth project explores the potential of leveraging AI, specifically the GPT-4 model, as an interrogation tool. The aim is to assess its effectiveness and limitations in investigative scenarios.

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

The study comprises three cases, each evaluating the AI's performance in different investigative scenarios. The methodology involves simulated conversations with the AI, analyzing its ability to gather relevant information and make deductions.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

Findings suggest promising capabilities of the AI in initiating conversations and formulating relevant inquiries. However, limitations include difficulty in determining the truthfulness of responses and maintaining focus on the main issue.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

While the AI demonstrates potential as an investigative tool, significant constraints exist, particularly in assessing the veracity of statements. Further research and development are necessary to enhance its effectiveness.

## Future Works <a name="future-works"></a>

Future efforts will focus on expanding the scope of inquiry, refining interrogation methods, and ensuring adherence to ethical standards in communication.

## References <a name="references"></a>

References to relevant documentation and tools used in the project.

## Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>
