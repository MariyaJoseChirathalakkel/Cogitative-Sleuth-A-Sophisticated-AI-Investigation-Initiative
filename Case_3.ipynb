Analysis Interview\n","The Behaviour Analysis Interview (BAI) is a critical technique in investigative processes, attempting to\n","obtain crucial information from persons via a systematic question-and-answer session [1]. This strategy is\n","distinguished by its non-accusatory nature, which involves a combination of normal investigative queries\n","and behavior-provoking questions [1]. These questions are carefully intended to elicit responses that can\n","reveal truth or deception, ultimately assisting investigators in their pursuit of justice [1].\n","Investigators often start a BAI by asking background questions to establish baseline behavior and obtain\n","personal information about the individual under investigation [1]. This initial phase has two functions: it\n","allows investigators to examine the subject's usual verbal and nonverbal behavior while also establishing\n","the framework for rapport development [1]. Then, behavior-provoking questions are provided, which are\n","intentionally designed to elicit diverse verbal and nonverbal responses from both truthful and fraudulent\n","suspects [1]. Interwoven with these inquiries are investigative questions designed to offer light on the\n","specifics of the case under investigation [1].\n","The objective evaluation of responses is crucial to the BAI process in determining the authenticity of the\n","subject's remarks [1]. Investigators can gain insight into an individual's veracity by observing both verbal\n","and nonverbal indicators [1]. Furthermore, the BAI serves as a precursor to more rigorous interrogation\n","techniques, giving investigators significant insights into the suspect's demeanor and mindset, which can\n","help them build an effective interrogation plan [1].\n","While the BAI protocol is a standardized series of 15 questions, its ability to discern between innocent\n","and criminal defendants has been questioned [1]. Empirical research has challenged assumptions\n","underlying the BAI, such as the idea that guilty people are more uncomfortable and unwilling to comply\n","[1]. Studies have found differences between expected and observed behaviors, calling into question the\n","BAI's ability to effectively determine guilt or innocence [1].\n","However, behavioral analysis goes beyond the scope of the BAI protocol, embracing a larger assessment\n","of behavior to determine its underlying causes and relevance [2]. This perspective, based on disciplines\n","such as psychology, sociology, and criminology, sees behavior as a multidimensional phenomena\n","influenced by both internal and external forces [2]. Behavioral analysis, whether used in business for\n","employee screening or by law enforcement for criminal profiling, provides useful insights into human\n","behavior in a variety of circumstances [2].\n","In the context of interviews and interrogations, the Coordinated Behavioural Response appears as a\n","sophisticated strategy to elicit information and obtain confessions [3]. Unlike inflexible, step-by-step\n","methods, this method emphasizes adaptability and reactivity to the subject's behavior [3]. Investigators\n","can successfully negotiate the complexities of the questioning process and achieve their investigative\n","goals by paying attention to minor signs and adapting their strategies accordingly [3].\n","An instance scenario demonstrates the need of adapting to the subject's behavior during interrogation [4].\n","The Coordinated Behavioural Response approach emphasizes the necessity for investigators to avoid\n","formulaic tactics in favor of personalized strategies that are consistent with the subject's demeanor and\n","mentality [4]. This adaptable approach, typified by the \"Interview to Confession, The Gentle Art of\n","Interrogation\" methodology, emphasizes rapport building and the strategic use of interrogation tactics to\n","obtain valuable information [4].\n","Furthermore, the BAI process goes beyond the interview itself. Following the initial interview, detectives\n","frequently examine the suspect's verbal and nonverbal behaviors with known facts and evidence from the\n","case. This comprehensive technique aids in determining the possibility of the suspect's involvement in the\n","case under investigation[5].\n","One key feature of the BAI is the recognition that behavioral clues alone do not determine guilt or\n","innocence. Instead, they act as indicators for future inquiry. The interpretation of these cues involves\n","careful consideration of a number of elements, including the gravity of the crime, the suspect's mental\n","condition, and their cultural background.\n","Furthermore, the success of the BAI is dependent on the interviewer's ability to maintain a nonjudgmental\n","and non-accusatory demeanor throughout the process. Any divergence from this method may instill\n","distrust or animosity in the suspect, influencing their behavior and jeopardizing the interview's\n","integrity[5].\n","The BAI, like any other investigative technique, has its limitations. One significant difficulty is its\n","vulnerability to manipulation by adept deceivers. Despite standards aiming at reducing errors, there is\n","always the possibility of false positive results, in which innocent people are mistakenly labeled as\n","guilty[5].\n","To summarize, the Behaviour Analysis Interview and its associated techniques are useful weapons in the\n","arsenal of investigators [1]. While the BAI provides useful insights into dubious behavior, its use\n","necessitates meticulous attention to detail and strict adherence to established norms. Further research and\n","refinement of the BAI procedure are required to improve its reliability and effectiveness in discriminating\n","between guilty and innocent individuals[5]. Law enforcement organizations can improve their ability to\n","find the truth and uphold justice by combining behavioral analysis with other investigative\n","approaches.While the BAI offers a formal framework for determining truth and deceit, its shortcomings\n","highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to behavioral analysis [1]. By embracing the\n","principles of a Coordinated Behavioural Response, investigators can navigate the intricacies of interviews\n","and interrogations with ease, promoting case resolution and the pursuit of justice [3].\n","References\n","1. https://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/rpt/2014-R-0071.htm\n","2. https://criminal-justice.iresearchnet.com/forensic-psychology/police-psychology/behavior-analysi\n","s-interview/\n","3. https://www.police1.com/investigations/articles/behavioral-analysis-in-the-interrogation-room-mt\n","FE1DorLvsQEs1T/\n","4. http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.mhp-f28e603b-3e6c-474a-9660-e5db20d3\n","ee7e/c/EP_2008_2_03_horvath.pdf\n"]}],"source":["# this is where you load your pdf document content into\n","# a variable that goes into your Prompt\n","#\n","document = \"\"\n","with pdfplumber.open(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Deep_Learning_2024/Assignment/Case_3/Behavior Analysis Interview.pdf\") as pdf:\n","            for page in pdf.pages:\n","                text = page.extract_text(x_tolerance=1)\n","                print(text)\n","                document += text"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t97Xn3NUXzM9"},"source":["# **Introgation with Mia**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"peX1tdwrYrTP"},"outputs":[],"source":["# this is the Langchain Template structure that allows you to use a third variable\n","# to include a document into your Prompt\n","#\n","prompt = PromptTemplate(\n","    template=\"\"\"\n","Act like you are an investigating officer.

a house with five bedrooms.Their names are Najeeb, Hafis, Mia, Joe, Susan, Vishnu, Vishwa, and Hari.\n","\n","The tenancy agreement will only be written in the names of five people, and three must stay illegally.\n","\n","Mia, Joe, Susan, and Vishnu are from the same region. As a result, the four of them agreed to share three rooms.Mia contacted Joe before moving into the residence since he was the only one she knew.\n","\n","To get the accommodation, she sent 440 GBP to a person's account, as instructed by Joe. Joe informed Mia that the total rent is 1700 and every person was expected to pay 440.Mia was also not aware that there will be 8 people.She thought she was the only extra person in that house.\n","Susan handled the property agreement and all other financial processes for the entire house.\n","\n","Before beginning the tenancy, each person was required to provide a deposit of 100 GBP and a one-month rent advance (340 GBP).\n","\n","Joe also informed Mia that he did not have any guarantor and hence he must pay 2 month rent advance instead of one month.He also mentioned that he don't have enough money for that.So if Mia have a guarantor or if she can give 2 months rent they can ask the agency to  write the agreement in her name.But Mia decided to give half of the second month rent advance to Joe and the agreement will be written in his name.\n","\n","After 2 years all of them vacated the house.The agency  sent an amount of 383 GBP  to every tenant who was in the agreement.This amount is after reducing a cleaning charge from the 440 each person gave. The agency also sent the non guarantor payment to the respective person.\n","\n","When the refund was credited to Joe’s account he sent 142 GBP to Mia.

How can I assist you today?\n","User > what is your findings about the case \n","ChatBot : Based on the conversations with Mia, Joe, Susan, and Vishnu, the analysis of the case findings indicates discrepancies and inconsistencies in the financial arrangements and communications among the housemates. Here are the key points:\n","\n","1. **Financial Arrangements and Miscommunications**: Mia was under the impression she was paying an equal share for the rent and was unaware of the total number of people living in the house. Joe was her primary point of contact, and she trusted him with the financial transactions, including a significant upfront payment and additional contributions towards Joe's rent due to his lack of a guarantor.\n","\n","2. **Deposit and Refund Discrepancy**: Upon vacating the house, Mia received a partial refund from Joe, which did not align with her expectations based on the amounts paid initially. Joe's explanation of the refund calculation did not satisfy Mia, and there was no transparent communication about how the cleaning charge or any other deductions were applied.\n","\n","3. **Lack of Transparency and Accountability**: Susan, who handled the property agreement and financial processes, and Joe, who was the main point of contact for Mia, both showed a lack of responsibility in addressing Mia's concerns regarding the financial discrepancies. There were no records or receipts of transactions, and Susan distanced herself from the dispute between Mia and Joe.\n","\n","4. **Emotional and Social Impact**: The financial and housing arrangement issues significantly impacted Mia's emotional well-being and her relationships with the housemates. Her trust in Joe and Susan was compromised, leading to her decision to move out.\n","\n","5. **Culprit Identification**: While it's challenging to pinpoint a single culprit without further evidence, Joe appears to bear significant responsibility for the mismanagement of financial arrangements and lack of transparency. His actions and responses suggest a disregard for fair treatment and accountability. Susan's role in managing the finances also raises questions about the oversight of payments and refunds, although her direct involvement in the discrepancy is less clear.\n","\n","In conclusion, Joe's handling of the financial arrangements with Mia, coupled with the lack of transparency and accountability from both Joe and Susan, suggests that they are primarily responsible for the issues encountered by Mia. Further investigation and evidence would be needed to fully resolve the financial discrepancies and determine the appropriate restitution for Mia.\n","User > who is the culprit and why\n","ChatBot : Based on the detailed analysis of the conversations and the case findings, the primary culprit in the case appears to be Joe. Here's why:\n","\n","1. **Misrepresentation of Financial Arrangements**: Joe misrepresented the financial arrangements to Mia from the beginning. He did not disclose the total number of people living in the house and led Mia to believe she was paying an equal share like the others. This lack of transparency and honesty from the start sets the foundation for the issues that followed.\n","\n","2. **Mismanagement of Mia's Payments**: Joe was responsible for managing Mia's payments, including her rent and the additional amount she paid under the impression it would cover a lack of a guarantor. The discrepancy in the refund amount and his failure to provide a clear and fair explanation further implicates him in the mismanagement of funds.\n","\n","3. **Lack of Transparency and Accountability**: Joe's lack of transparency regarding the financial arrangements, especially about how the refund was calculated and his refusal to provide Mia with details or address her concerns directly, suggests a disregard for fair treatment and accountability.\n","\n","4. **Manipulation**: Joe's actions suggest a manipulation of the situation for his benefit. By not providing Mia with accurate information and failing to address her concerns adequately, he maintained control over the situation to his advantage.\n","\n","5. **Impact on Mia**: Joe's actions directly impacted Mia's financial situation and emotional well-being. The stress and anxiety caused by the unresolved financial discrepancies and the lack of support from Joe significantly affected her experience living in the house.\n","\n","While Susan also played a role in managing the property agreement and financial processes, her direct involvement in the discrepancy related to Mia's payments and refund is less clear. Susan's lack of action and distancing herself from the situation does raise questions about her oversight and responsibility but does not directly implicate her as the primary culprit in the financial mismanagement experienced by Mia.\n","\n","Therefore, Joe is identified as the primary culprit due to his direct involvement in the misrepresentation of financial arrangements, mismanagement of payments, lack of transparency, and the significant negative impact his actions had on Mia.\n","User > how did it affected Mia \n","ChatBot : Mia was significantly affected by the situation in several ways:\n","\n","1. **Financial Stress**: Mia experienced financial stress due to the mismanagement and discrepancies in the payment arrangements. She paid more than what was initially agreed upon, believing it would cover additional costs, such as the lack of a guarantor for Joe. The partial refund she received from Joe did not match her expectations based on her initial payments, leading to further financial strain.\n","\n","2. **Emotional Distress**: The lack of transparency, accountability, and support from Joe and Susan, coupled with the financial discrepancies, led to emotional distress for Mia. She felt deceived and manipulated, which is evident from her expressions of depression and loss of trust in Joe and Susan. This situation likely contributed to a sense of isolation and vulnerability, exacerbating her stress and anxiety levels.\n","\n","3. **Impact on Trust and Relationships**: Mia's trust in her housemates, particularly Joe, was severely damaged. The situation negatively impacted her relationships with other housemates as well, leading to her feeling isolated within the living environment.
