ChatBot : Did Joe mention anything about additional payments or deposits required for those without a guarantor?
User : yes.he said he dont have guarantor.so he need to pay extra one month rent as non guarantor payment.if I can pay that amount or if I have a guarantor the agreement could be written in my name.since he was helping me with the house I told him I can give half of the non guarantor payment and am okay with writing the tenancy agreement in his name
